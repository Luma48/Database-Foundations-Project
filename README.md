# Database-Foundations-Project
This is a github repo for the Database Foundations Project from team 110 (Danilo Mutavdzic, Daniel Jaurell Mevorach, Hassan Raza, Nick Maharjan). In this project we will create a database for a driving school 
using all our collective knowledge on SQL, ERD modelling and so on.
